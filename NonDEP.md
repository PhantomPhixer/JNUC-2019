# Non DEP builds #

## Background ##

The overall aim of this workflow is to have a near indentical experience building DEP and Non DEP devices.
Lot's of organisations have devices that can't be DEP built for many reasons.
The overall end aim of this workflow is to get all devices managed in Jamf and then to automatically be able to wipe and reprovision the device.
The only major difference between the two workflows, DEP and Non DEP, is the requirement for a user to approve the MDM profile in the Non DEP build devices, which can't be avoided.


## Experience ##
The overall experience will be the same type choice and notify experience as used in the DEP build out lined [here](https://github.com/PhantomPhixer/JNUC-2019/blob/master/DEP.md).
