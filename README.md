# JNUC-2019
This repository contains the scripts and other useful info related to my JNUC 2019 presentation entitled *Build it and they will come* which was about using Jamf, MDS and macOS eraseinstall to create automatic workflows for provisioning and re-provisioning macOS devices that use DEP and those that can't use DEP.
