# JNUC-2019
This repository contains the scripts and other useful info related to my JNUC 2019 presentation entitled *Build it and they will come* which was about using Jamf, MDS and macOS eraseinstall to create automatic workflows for provisioning and re-provisioning macOS devices that use DEP and those that can't use DEP.

## Overall Flow ##

The overall flow of this talk is how to bring mac devices into jamf management with a common, or at least a known, clean OS and then to be able to erase and reprovision then automatically, possibly with no interaction at all, regardless of whether they are DEP capable or not.

As the flow shows the *Build* part is common allowing simple management of the build process.
